# Folenta Portfolio (a WordPress Theme)

## Introduction
WordPress is one of the most if not the most popular platforms for building websites on the internet today. I can't remember the first time I used it since it was so long ago. My experience with WordPress was sort of here and there. I knew how to navigate around the admin, manage a website, edit theme files and of course install and update plugins. It wasn't until about 2 years ago that I got more in depth with WordPress and working with theme files. I've learned that specific theme files have specific roles in how WordPress functions and handles specific types of content. I wanted to go deeper and actually learn about every type template file and what its specific purpose is to WordPress. So what better way to dive deeper than to build my own custom template?

## My Goal
To be able to recreate my personal portfolio website which was created in React and convert the design into a custom WordPress template.
